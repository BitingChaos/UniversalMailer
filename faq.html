					<h1>FAQ</h1>

					<h3>I updated to the latest OS X version but now Universal Mailer has been disabled!</h3>
					<p>
					This will happen with every new versions of Mail.app, that's something we have to live
					with when using plugins form Mail. There's however a good news: most of the time all you
					have to do is to run the installer of Universal Mailer again, it will magically re-enable
					the plugin for you!
					</p>
					<p>
					There's however a catch here: if a major OS X update comes out (Mavericks is a good example)
					be sure to check this website for updates, there might be a new version that needs to
					be used with the updated Mail.app!
					</p>

					<h3>Everything is working ok but can you suggest a font size for a 'readable' email?</h3>
					<p>
					It largely depends on your personal tastes and also what you mean by 'readable', however
					I suggest to start with a Helvetica fonts with size 14, and I would specify using points
					instead of pixels.
					</p>

					<h3>When I send an email my signature doesn't match the font I specified in Universal
							Mailer</h3>
					<p>
					This is not a problem of the plugin: the default font is set for all the text that hasn't
					other font specifications: if you set a specific font for a part of the body (signature
					included) it will retain your size, not the default one.
					</p>
					<p>
					Also, be sure to use points and pixels consistently: if you use 15 points in your body,
					specifying 15 pixels in your signature might be the same on your screen but it certainly
					change with other screen resolutions! Be sure to double check your signature specification
					and configure Universal Mailer to do the same.
					</p>

					<h3>I'm trying to install the software but the system complains it comes from an
							'Unidentified Developer'</h3>
					<p>
					This plugin is not signed with an Apple Developer Certificate, and this is the reason
					you get this error. You can override this problem by right-clicking the installation
					file and select 'Open'. This will produce a warning also, but you can continue with
					the installation.
					Another method, which is not advised since it might expose to security risks, is to
					temporary (or permanently, if you wish to do so) disable 
					this extra security check to install the plugin, here's how: go to System Preferences,
					select Security &amp; Privacy and select 'Anywhere' in the 'Allow apps downloaded from'.
					This operation might require you to click on the yellow on lock on the bottom left of
					the window and enter your password. After you installed the plugin you can safely switch
					to your previous setting, too.
					</p>

					<h3>I'm done with the plugin, how can I remove it?</h3>
					<p>
					If you're done with the plugin, the easiest way to remove it is to use
					<a href="https://smallcubed.com/mpm/" alt="Mail Plugin Manager">Mail Plugin Manager</a>,
					a free software provided by MailTags.
					</p>

					<h3>After I installed the plugin nothing happens, the plugin is not working!</h3>
					<p>
					First, check if you have the plugin installed: you can tell this by opening Mail.app's
					Preferences. If you see a '&gt;&gt;' symbol on the top right or the Universal Mailer logo,
					the plugin is there.
					</p>
					<p>
					Be sure to avoid conflicts between Mail.app's plugins: due to the way Apple handles third
					parties plugin in Mail, two similar plugins might lead to one of them not working. There
					are no brilliant solutions here: just try one plugin at a time and keep only those you
					prefer.
					</p>
					<p>
					If the plugin is not installed you can run
					<a href="https://smallcubed.com/mpm/" alt="Mail Plugin Manager">Mail Plugin Manager</a>,
					it will help you manage Mail.app's plugins.
					</p>

					<h3>After I launch Mail.app an alert complains about the plugin not being compatible</h3>
					<p>
					This error might be shown when the installer failed to detect the version of Mail.app
					you have.
					To solve this problem you can run
					<a href="https://smallcubed.com/mpm/" alt="Mail Plugin Manager">Mail Plugin Manager</a>.
					</p>

					<h3>Why UniversalMailer v3 supports OS X El Capitan only?</h3>
					<p>
					There are various reasons for this and here's a list of them, it is not complete nor in a particular order:

					<ul>
							<li>El Capitan hardware requirements are almost the same as Mavericks and Yosemite. If you're running
							a older version of OS X you should consider updating to the latest one anyway, in my opinion.</li>
							<li>I don't have enough time nor enough (virtual) machines to test the plugin on older version of OS X,
							so I prefer dropping support to avoid hunting for bugs on older systems</li>
							<li>Technically speaking the plugin should work on Mavericks and Yosemite too. If you're brave enough
							to do so, download the source code and set the deployment target to 10.9 or 10.10, then compile your own
							custom version.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>I think there's a bug!</h3>
					<p>
					If you encounter a bug inside the plugin you should first go through all the FAQs (and since
					you are reading this I suppose you already did so), then try to identify the steps that
					caused it and submit a new
					<a href="https://github.com/UniversalMailer/UniversalMailer/issues" alt="issue">issue</a>.
					It is of much help to read the existing issues to avoid duplicates: the more duplicates the
					more the time to read them, the more the time to read them the lesser the time available to look at
					the code and solve it. Sounds simple and complicated at the same time.
					</p>
					<p>
					Also, if you tag the issue with 'Bug' it speeds things up when reviewing open issues.
					</p>

					<h3>I want a new feature!</h3>
					<p>
					Think about it twice: are you sure this feature should be included inside UniversalMailer?
					If so, describe it by creating a new
					<a href="https://github.com/UniversalMailer/UniversalMailer/issues" alt="issue">issue</a>.
					It helps if you tag it as 'enhancement' and it also really helps if you explain it in simple
					terms, don't assume I'm smart :-)
					</p>

					<h3>I want to help!</h3>
					<p>
					Great! There are many ways to help here: you can either contribute by improving the code
					(cloning the project and filing a merge request is the way to go) or with anything you
					think it might help with the plugin such as improvements in the messages, improved graphics, help
					with the website, you name it...

					<h3>I tried everything in here but I'm still in troubles!</h3>
					<p>
					If nothing here seems to help, you can send an email at universal.mailer.noware AT gmail.com,
					you'll get support as soon as possible!
					</p>

					<h3>What about the team behind UniversalMailer?</h3>
					<p>
					It's as easy as a one man team, i.e. that's only one developer: me. This is to say you shouldn't
					expect frequent release or prompt responses: it largely depends on how busy I am at the moment.
					I promise I'll read all your emails and issues but you can experience a delay in the response
					from 1 hour to 1 month or something similar :-)
