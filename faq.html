					<h1>FAQ</h1>

					<h3>After I installed the plugin nothing happens, the plugin is not working!</h3>
					<p>
					First, check if you have the plugin installed: you can tell this by opening Mail.app's
					Preferences. If you see a '&gt;&gt;' symbol on the top right or the Universal Mailer logo,
					the plugin is there.
					</p>
					<p>
					Be sure to avoid conflicts between Mail.app's plugins: due to the way Apple handles third
					parties plugin in Mail, two similar plugins might lead to one of them not working. There
					are no brilliant solutions here: just try one plugin at a time and keep only those you
					use.
					</p>
					<p>
					If the plugin is not installed you can run a few commands from Terminal.app (you can find
					it under /Applications/Utilities) to ensure that everything is correctly set up. Some of those
					commands might ask you for a password: enter your login password followed by the enter key.
					Please note that there won't be any echo to the screen when you type the password and, if
					you never have used 'sudo' before, the system will warn you about its usage: it's all ok, the
					commands listed here won't do anything harmful to your computer and you can safely enter
					the password!
					</p>
					<code class="prettyprint">&gt; defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles -bool YES<br/>
							&gt; defaults write com.apple.mail BundleCompatibilityVersion -int 3<br/>
							&gt; sudo defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles -bool YES<br/>
							&gt; sudo defaults write com.apple.mail BundleCompatibilityVersion -int 3
					</code>

					<h3>After I launch Mail.app an alert complains about the plugin not being compatible</h3>
					<p>
					This error might be shown when the installer failed to detect the version of Mail.app
					you have.
					To solve this problem, you can proceed as follow:
					<ul>
							<li>open Terminal.app from /Application/Utilities</li>
							<li>enter these two commands and hit the enter key after each one:
								<code class="prettyprint">&gt; cat /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep UUID -A 1</code>
						  	<code class="prettyprint">&gt; cat /System/Library/Frameworks/Message.framework/Resources/Info.plist | grep UUID -A 1</code>
							</li>
							<li>they both should output two lines, with the second one containing a strange UUID (similar to this, for example: 04D6EC0A-52FF-4BBE-9896-C0B5FB851BBA)</li>
							<li>open Finder, select Go-&gt;Go to Folder... and enter '~/Library/Mail/Bundles' in the prompt that appears</li>
							<li>you should see a bundle named UniversalMailer.mailbundle: ctrl+click it and select 'Show Package Contents'</li>
							<li>open 'Contents' directory and you'll see a file named Info.plist</li>
							<li>edit Info.plist with a text editor (TextEdit is fine) and enter the two UUID you 
							got before at the end of the file (you'll see here other UUIDs, you can either
							replace them or add new lines by enclosing them in 
							<code class="prettyprint">&lt;string&gt;</code> and 
							<code class="prettyprint">&lt;/string&gt;</code> tags</li>
							Note that on Mavericks you'll have just one UUID, the first one: it's not something
							that you're missing!
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>I installed the plugin and I think it's loaded by Mail.app. Why doesn't it do what
					it should?</h3>
					<p>
					Check <a href="usage.html" alt="usage">Installation & Usage</a> page and be sure to use
					a signature in your emails to enforce rich text emails.
					</p>

					<h3>Everything is working ok but can you suggest a font size for a 'readable' email?</h3>
					<p>
					It largely depends on your personal tastes and also what you mean by 'readable', however
					I suggest to start with a Helvetica fonts with size 14, and I would specify using points
					instead of pixels. On newer versions of OS X (i.e. Mavericks and above) it seems to be
					better to use pixels instead of points because of a change Apple made on Mail.app.
					</p>

					<h3>When I send an email my signature doesn't match the font I specified in Universal
							Mailer</h3>
					<p>
					This is not a problem of the plugin: the default font is set for all the text that hasn't
					other font specifications: if you set a specific font for a part of the body (signature
					included) it will retain your size, not the default one.
					</p>
					<p>
					Also, be sure to use points and pixels consistently: if you use 15 points in your body,
					specifying 15 pixels in your signature might be the same on your screen but it certainly
					change with other screen resolutions! Be sure to double check your signature specification
					and configure Universal Mailer to do the same.
					</p>

					<h3>I updated to the latest OS X version but now Universal Mailer has been disabled!</h3>
					<p>
					This will happen with every new versions of Mail.app, that's something we have to live
					with when using plugins form Mail. There's however a good news: most of the time all you
					have to do is to run the installer of Universal Mailer again, it will magically re-enable
					the plugin for you!
					</p>
					<p>
					There's however a catch here: if a major OS X update comes out (Mavericks is a good example)
					be sure to check this website for updates, there might be a new version that needs to
					be used with the new Mail.app!
					</p>

					<h3>I'm trying to install the software but the system complains it comes from an
							'Unidentified Developer'</h3>
					<p>
					This plugin is not signed with an Apple Developer Certificate, and this is the reason
					you get this error. You can override this problem by right-clicking the installation
					file and select 'Open'. This will produce a warning also, but you can continue with
					the installation.
					Another method, which is not advised since it might expose to security risks, is to
					temporary (or permanently, if you wish to do so) disable 
					this extra security check to install the plugin, here's how: go to System Preferences,
					select Security &amp; Privacy and select 'Anywhere' in the 'Allow apps downloaded from'.
					This operation might require you to click on the yellow on lock on the bottom left of
					the window and enter your password. After you installed the plugin you can safely switch
					to your previous setting, too.
					</p>

					<h3>I'm done with the plugin, how can I remove it?</h3>
					<p>
					Are you sure? Are you really sure? No, really, you want to remove the plugin?</br>
					YES<br/>
					Well, that's ok :) To remove it just delete UniversalMailer.mailbundle from
				 	~/Library/Mail/Bundles or /Library/Mail/Bundles (it depends on your configuration
				  where you'll find the plugin bundle) and restart Mail.app. That's it, no other leftover or something.
					</p>

					<h3>I tried everything here but I'm still in troubles!</h3>
					<p>
					If nothing here seems to help, you can send an email at universal.mailer.noware AT gmail.com,
					you'll get support as soon as possible!
