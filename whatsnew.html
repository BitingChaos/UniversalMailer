					<h1>What's new</h1>

					<h3>27/05/2016 - Version 3 is out!</h3>
					<p>
					Big announcement here! UniversalMailer reached version 3!
					</p>

					<h4>So, what's up with version 3?</h4>
					<p>
					Version 3 is a complete rewrite of version 2, which is both something good and something bad.
					Here's a list of good things:
					<ul>
							<li>The plugin improved its email handling features, especially when dealing with attachments (both inline and not inline)</li>
							<li><b>You don't need an HTML signature anymore, UniversalMailer will do its job even with plain text emails</b>.</li>
							<li>You can now provide your own CSS for email customization. This is a sort of an advanced feature but it's 
								a major feature for those of you that needs deep style customization.</li>
							<li>UniversalMailer source code now stands by its own: version 3 dropped the mimetic library dependency, which was
							 really too much for it: it now includes a custom made MIME pseudo-parser suited for its specific job. This is maybe
							 of no importance to the vast majority but worth a bullet point here :-)</li>
							<li>There's a new preference panel! This version is an oversimplified translation of the v1 and v2 panels, it should be
							 more user friendly!</li>
					</ul>

					And here's the list of bad things:
					<ul>
							<li>Version 2 was largely tested by users, version 3 it's not at the moment. Expect bugs (hopefully, only new bugs and not regressions).</li>
							<li>Version 3 dropped supports for older OS X, this is something I really like but you may disagree.</li>
					</ul>
